// linkedList question
// Reverse:
//
//   Rewatch the video we saw in class on Monday to visualize using pointers to reverse a linked list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7y_hoT_YZI
//
//   Then, practice drawing the reversing process on a piece of paper. (Tip: use a small linked list of 3-4 nodes so it doesn't take you too long)
//
// Then write the code to reverse a linked list. Try not to look at your notes from class! If you need an extra challenge, try writing it recursively (that is not required or expected though).
//
// Remove:
//
//   Watch the following video to visualize deleting a node from a linked list. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCRGaWXGOKU She uses Java to code the solution, but don't worry about the Java code unless it's helpful to you. Focus on the visualization/process steps. You can also use VisuAlgo to visualize this if you'd like.
//
// Then, practice drawing the removal process on a piece of paper. (Tip: use a small linked list of 3-4 nodes so it doesn't take you too long)
//
// Then try to write the code to remove a node from a linked list.
//
//   Copy and paste your code here for both functions. They don't need to be perfect, just try your best!
